```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
library(ggmap)
library(eviatlas)

```


```{r}
# For some reason, I'm having issues with readr, so I'll munge the data here - for now.

lat <- pilotdata$`Plotted lat.`
lng <- pilotdata$`Plotted long.`

```


## Objective 

As a starting point, create a map that plots the points on a leaflet map and sizes the points by $n$. 

## Get points on a map

```{r Plot dd}

pilotdata %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = lng,
             lat = lat)


```
