<span class="c12"><h3>About EviAtlas</h3></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">EviAtlas is an Open Source tool for creating and hosting visualisations from databases of studies created within systematic maps and systematic reviews. The tool was created as part of the ongoing Evidence Synthesis Hackathon series of events (</span><span class="c4"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.evidencesynthesishackathon.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553166383780000">www.evidencesynthesishackathon.com</a></span><span class="c0">) aimed at producing free-to-use tools to support systematic reviews and maps across disciplines.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">EviAtlas allows users to create a suite of visualisations from a database of studies, including Evidence Atlases (interactive geographical maps showing studies and their details over space), Heat Maps (cross tabulations of categorical variables that highlight clusters and gaps in the evidence), descriptive plots that help to visualise the evidence base (e.g. the number of publications per year), and human-readable databases that are easily filterable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">EviAtlas is build on coding written in R (</span><span class="c4"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.r-project.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553166383781000">https://www.r-project.org</a></span><span class="c0">) and uses a Shiny App to provide a web-based user interface. As we develop the app further, we will provide source code to allow R users to further refine their visualisations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">EviAtlas is currently in a testing phase but is fully functional. We intend to add further options and functionality in the near future.

  <h3>Systematic Maps and Systematic Reviews</h3></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Systematic maps and reviews are rigorous, comprehensive, transparent and repeatable methods for reviewing research literature on a particular topic. Systematic maps are overviews of nature of an evidence base relevant to a broad (open) question of policy or management relevance. Systematic reviews are detailed analyses of the findings of a group of similar studies, for example examining the effectiveness of an intervention or the impact of a factor. More information about systematic reviews and maps can be found for the following disciplines: </span><span class="c4"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.environmentalevidence.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553166383782000">environment</a></span><span class="c6">, </span><span class="c4"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://campbellcollaboration.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553166383783000">social welfare and international development</a></span><span class="c6">, </span><span class="c4"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cochrane.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553166383783000">healthcare</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">During the process of conducting a systematic map or systematic review, researchers typically produce a detailed database of relevant studies that includes various columns of descriptive information. Some of this data may be rich, textual descriptions (meta-data), and some of it may be categorical or numerical data (coding or quantitative data). Coding (for example different levels of a factor; high, medium, low, or different country names) allows a database to be easily filtered and searched, and allows the production of interactive visualisations of the evidence base to examine what research has been conducted, when, where, how, by whom, etc.. EviAtlas is the first Open Source tool that allows users to produce a range of different visualisations for their systematic reviews and maps. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8">
    
    <h3>How EviAtlas Works</h3></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Upload a systematic review dataset (csv format) using the panel on the right, and then use the left sidebar to view a systematic map generated from your dataset, as well as some common plots used in systematic reviews.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Please ensure that your database is formatted in the correct way - column labels should all appear in the first row. To create an Evidence Atlas you will need one column with latitude data and one with longitude data; you can select these spatial variables in the Evidence Atlas pane. Please provide the lat/long in decimal degrees. </span><span class="c6">In the future we hope to provide tools to recognise multiple coordinate types</span><span class="c6">. If you have categorical variables that you wish to cross-tabulate in a Heat Map or other visualisation, EviAtlas currently requires that you store these categories in a single column. </span><span class="c6">In the future we hope to integrate </span><span class="c6 c11">tidy </span><span class="c6">principles that will allow you to aggregate and disaggregate complex data automatically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Please use the example dataset to see what EviAtlas can do!</span></p>
