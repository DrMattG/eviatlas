# EviAtlas

EviAtlas is a shiny app for visualising the datasets produced by systematic maps. You can download eviatlas from github and run it in one step with this code:

``` r
# install.packages("shiny")
shiny::runGitHub("ESHackathon/eviatlas")
```

EviAtlas was produced as part of the first Evidence Synthesis Hackathon, hosted by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and organized by researchers at SEI and the Australian National University. 
The tool was created by and for the open-source research community. Pull requests and suggestions for future improvements are welcome. 

As of January 2019, EviAtlas is currently at version 0.1.
